#Postmates Android API Wrapper

The classes you need to use are: PostmatesAPI, Delivery, and DeliveryQuote.

TestCallback exists only to make outputting json data easier. You can customize your callbacks so that the response can be converted to a JSONObject, String, etc.

MainActivity serves no purpose than to test the API with random parameters.

HAVE FUN and GO POSTMATES!

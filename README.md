#Postmates Android API Wrapper

The classes you should take for consuming the Postmates API are: ***PostmatesAPI, Delivery, and DeliveryQuote***.

TestCallback exists only to make outputting json data easier. You can customize your callbacks so that the response can be converted to a JSONObject, String, etc.

MainActivity serves no purpose than to test the API with random parameters.

HAVE FUN and GO POSTMATES!

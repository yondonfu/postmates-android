#Postmates Android API Wrapper

Classes you should use for API: 

***PostmatesAPI.java, Delivery.java, and DeliveryQuote.java***

TestCallback,java exists only to make outputting chunks of json data easier when I was making the wrapper. You can customize your callbacks for each api call so that the response can be converted to an object of your choice: JSONObject, String, etc.

MainActivity.java serves no purpose than to test the API with random parameters.

HAVE FUN SPREADING POSTMATES!

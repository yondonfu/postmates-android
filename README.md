#Postmates Android API Wrapper

Classes you should use for API: 

***PostmatesAPI.java, Delivery.java, and DeliveryQuote.java***

TestCallback,java exists only to make outputting json data easier. You can customize your callbacks so that the response can be converted to a JSONObject, String, etc.

MainActivity.java serves no purpose than to test the API with random parameters.

HAVE FUN SPREADING POSTMATES!
